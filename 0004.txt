You have started a new year, checked your savings, and are looking ahead to the next 12 months, hoping maybe for a pay rise? Well, if you live in the UK, your boss may well have made more money already than you could earn in a whole year.

The date of 4 January is marked as the day when CEOs of Britain's biggest companies already earn what it takes an average worker to make in a year.

But British CEOs are not the only ones who out-earn their workers so quickly. An analysis of the wage gap between CEOs and workers in 22 countries by the financial and media company Bloomberg shows that executives in the United States and India can get the average worker's yearly wage even faster.

The Global CEO Index analyses how much more money executives make than someone on the average annual wage. In the United States, the data suggests that top CEOs need less than two days (1.52) to out-earn a worker's yearly income.
